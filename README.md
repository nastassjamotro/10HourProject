### Brief Review of the Game
- Hangman was originally a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. I've decided to turn this game into a program which can be played by a single person with just the necessity of an IDE that can run Java - no GUI interfaces involved.
- The way the game works is that one person would think of a word, phrase, or sentence _In this application, the program already has preprogrammed words in it._
- The other player, in this case the only player, tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers with a certain number of guesses. 
- The player may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins.
- Otherwise, the other player or in this case the program, will penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. _In my application, no visible diagram is shown but it'll be established when the guesser loses or wins._
- On the other hand, if the player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow for the invisible diagram to be completed, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing.
- However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
